Home Sales Analysis Report

Introduction
This report analyzes home sales data, focusing on trends related to property prices, construction year, and view ratings. The findings are derived from the dataset processed in the Jupyter Notebook.

1. Overview of Home Sales Data
The dataset includes various attributes such as:
- ID: Unique identifier for each property.
- Date of Sale: When the home was sold.
- Year Built: Construction year of the property.
- Price: Sale price of the home.
- Bedrooms & Bathrooms: Number of rooms.
- Sqft Living & Lot Size: Size of the house and lot.
- Floors: Number of floors.
- Waterfront: Whether the property has a waterfront.
- View: Rating assigned to the view from the property.

2. Trends in Home Prices Over Time
A breakdown of average home prices by construction year revealed the following trends:
- Homes built in 2010 had an average price of $296,800.75.
- Prices fluctuated slightly in subsequent years, with 2015 having the highest average price at $307,908.86.
- More recent homes (2016-2017) saw a slight decline in average prices, stabilizing around $296,576.69.

3. Impact of View Rating on Price
The view rating of a property significantly influences its price. A higher view rating (closer to 100) correlates with higher property prices:
- Homes with a view rating of 100 had an average price of $1,026,669.50.
- Ratings between 90-100 consistently showed high valuations exceeding $1M.
- Lower view ratings saw a decline in average prices, indicating a direct impact on market valuation.

4. Additional Observations
- Waterfront properties tend to have higher prices, though specific pricing data for these was not isolated in this analysis.
- The variation in price across different years suggests market fluctuations influenced by factors such as supply, demand, and economic conditions.

Conclusion
The analysis indicates that home prices are influenced by factors such as year built, view rating, and potentially waterfront presence. The highest-priced properties tend to have premium views, while newer properties do not necessarily command the highest prices. Future analysis could explore the role of additional factors like location and neighborhood trends.

Recommendations
- Homebuyers looking for investment opportunities may consider properties with high view ratings for better appreciation.
- Sellers with homes in high-view areas should price competitively to maximize profits.
- Further analysis could incorporate geographic factors to refine pricing trends.
